# prediction

# IMPORTANT: Prediction API is being closed down on April 30, 2018.

You should use the [Cloud ML Engine](../cloud-ml) instead.  This code will be left here simply for reference, as it could still be a useful guide to accessing Google ML APIs through Python (except not the Cloud ML Engine; that one is a little bit different.)

~~Demonstration of Google's Prediction APIs, consisting of a car loan evaluator application.  (This readme is still in BETA.)~~

## Before you begin

Be sure you have followed the setup steps in the README file in the google-apis directory so you can get set up with the Google Cloud Platform in general.

## Setting up for ~~the Prediction API demo~~ accessing your API of choice from Python

### Install dependencies

* Install Python 3.
* Install the Google API library for Python

`pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client`

* ~~Install Flask~~

~~`pip install flask`~~

### Enable ~~the Prediction API~~ your API of choice within your app

* I will need to go back through my notes and see if the following steps were actually necessary.  I don't recall having to explicitly enable Prediction in the API Console, but a lot happened so maybe I forgot.
  * Go back to the API Manager through the menu at left.
  * Click “Library”.
  * Under “Google Cloud APIs”, find your desired API.  You may need to click the “More” button to see it.
  * At the top left, next to where it lists your desired API, click the word “ENABLE.”
* Create credentials to use your API endpoint at this time.  Start by clicking "Create credentials".
* Click on "Service account key".
* I created a new Service Account called "test" that had a very permissive generic role selected (which ones?  TBD).  Add sufficient roles by clicking on them to show a checkmark by them.  They will also appear below the word "Selected".
* Select the "JSON" key type (should already be selected).
* There was another box I checked that was something to the effect of Give your service account Google Apps / User Domain / G Suite or etc . access, which then followed up with another prompt or two with stuff I had to fill out.  Basically the premise here is to give your service account similar permissions as any particular user on your Google App domain.
* Click "Create".  When you do, it will prompt you to make sure you put the JSON file in a safe place, because it will not make the same one twice.  Put the JSON credential file in mlworkshop/google-apis/keys (../keys from here).

### ~~Seed your Google Cloud Storage with the data~~

* ~~Download this file: <a href="http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~ahu340/eecs349-ps2/train.csv">http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~ahu340/eecs349-ps2/train.csv</a>.~~
* ~~Edit the data so that the columns are in the right format for the classifier.  What I recall this entailing was I needed to move the classification label for each example from the first column to the last column, and also to make sure I got rid of any and all double-quotes in the data set, so the only thing in the CSV file were alphanumeric characters and commas (and the occasional question mark representing missing data).~~
* ~~Upload this to your Google Cloud Storage bucket.~~
* ~~Using the APIs Explorer or some other means, make a new model and initiate the training on this data set.~~
